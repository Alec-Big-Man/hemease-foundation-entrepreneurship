        <h2 style="font-size: 16pt;">Our Story</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 14pt;">HemEase started with a simple problem faced by six college friends: the struggle of
            finding a convenient tailoring shop. Tailoring clothes cost too much money over time, and also can be a
            massive waste of time if you have to go out of your way to find a shop. That's why we started HemEase, to
            make sure all our tailor and dry cleaning needs can be done at home.</p>
