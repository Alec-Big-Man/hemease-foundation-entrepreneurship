                    Built-in sensors or a scanning system could measure the dimensions of garments, allowing precise
                    tailoring adjustments like hemming, taking in seams, or adjusting waistlines without needing manual
                    measurements.

                    Fabric recognition technology could identify the type of material and automatically adjust settings

                    A “Quick Fix” mode would allow for rapid hemming or cleaning in minutes for those times when users
                    need an urgent adjustment or refresh before an important event.

                    clothes to
                    their ideal fit.
